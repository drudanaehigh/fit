            While the advancements of the 90's came and went quickly, we as humans have an obligation to record our advancements.
        <br>
            This is why we at HowDoICode Labs have come together to create an archive for all of humanity to witness for all of eternity.
        <br>    
            3 adept scientists have gone through painstaking trouble to create this website to their fullest ability.
        <br>
            Unfortunately, only one scientist remains standing as a result of his sheer willpower to the cause.
        <br>
            These are their stories.

Rena Kani, also deceased. Called "The Crab" by the other loggers and scientists on the project due to her tendency of shaping her fingers into crab claws, as shown in the picture on the left. The picture on the left also highlights the insanity she developed whilst working on the project.
